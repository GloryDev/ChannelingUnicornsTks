#Self Sovereign Identity
## Background
## Digital Identity

### History of Digital Identity
Documents issues by State Authorities e.g. Id books, passports, drivers licenses.
Trusted Certificate Authorities issue certificates to certain sites that they are who 
they say they are and that they are safe to interact with.

Both of these suffer from the problems of centralisation.
A central corruptible authority possesses the sole right to either issue your identity
confirm your identity or withdraw your identity. This authority then has the right to 
directly control you and your life.
Identity managed by Site owners sharding of identity over large numbers of sites 
resulting in explosions of passwords and sharded identity, lock in, enter big tech 
- microsoft, Facebook, google all offering to solve the sharding of identity by placing 
themselves in the positions of powerful identity authorities for other sites.
Another problem arises because now your identity becomes so valuable to these sites 
that neither of them will ever conform to the others identity superiority and these 
authorities now become the central point of failure.

## Identity Structure

Identity - controlled by the user
Claims on Identity - made by the user or made by another user or group.
Claim - A statement about an Identity - e.g. a persons age, a rating of trustworthiness
 an assessment of a skill etc
Credentials - Entitlement to privileges usually in written form (usually state issued id paper or plastic).
 credentials usually includes one or more identifiers plus numerous claims about an entity.
Identifier - Name or label that uniquely identifies an identity.
Identity - representation of an entity. Can include claims and identifiers.
The user should always be in control of his or her identity.
User must be able to easily view all data and claims associated with his identity. 
This does not mean that they can necessarily modify the claims but they must have 
full visibility of all claims against their identity.
Consent to for claims to be attached to your identity. The consent may not be on a per claim basis but must
be deliberate. E.g. if I wish to become an Uber Driver then I give consent that my driving history and user 
ratings will be added to my identity as claims. Each update does not need to have an approval but the approval
has been given to that particular type of data being added to my identity.
If I enter into a loan agreement or a monthly payment I may consent that my identity is updated with my credit history

Claiming - bestowing - authority/skill etc e.g. Gabrial DJ'd at XXXX Camp and receive 
huge set of Tks for this. If Gabrial has the claimed or previously bestowed skill of DJ
then the tks go to this bucket otherwise he can claim the new bucket.
