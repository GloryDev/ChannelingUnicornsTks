## Ecosystems

We believe that each major leap forward in the evolution of earths planetary consciousness and hence the evolution of each and every species on our planet and in fact the entire universe has resulted directly from the discovery of a previously unknown method of creative collaboration between species and within species. In fact you could view the evolution of our universe as a series of moves to ever increasing levels of syntropic order. Where syntropy is defined as the tendency towards energy concentration and order, essentially syntropy plots the evolution of consciousness to ever increasing levels of complexity which is achieved by higher and higher levels of collaborative creation (interdependence) between seemingly separate parts.
We need only look at the evolution of single cell organisms to highly collaborative multicellular organisms of increasing complexity to understand syntropic order.

Non biological systems show all the signs of syntropic order (you merely have to look at the emergence of solar systems, planets etc to see this in action). Biological intelligence has however shown that it can dramatically accelerate the evolution towards higher and higher levels of syntropic order through its capacity to collaborate and co-create. In fact this biological intelligence has not only created massively self-organising self-regulating ecosystems but in fact weaved these together ecosystems together into a single self-organising collaborating ecosystem (intelligence) that goes by the name of Earth, PachaMama, Gaia and so many more.

## The current status quo of Human Civilisation

By now it is clear that humanity is at some sort of cust, a fork in the road. The current path of extractive hierarchically based economic systems are barrelling down a bleak path directly into the looming ecological collapse and economic disaster. You don't need to look far to see all the signs of this impending implosion.
While the current economic systems consisting of the government-military-industrial-petroleum-pharma-agricultural-education-BigTech barrels us towards this disaster these same systems despite their promises of improving human prosperity have instead continued to create systems that are increasingly human unfriendly. Again you do not need to look far to see all the evidence of this played out in every aspect of human life from souring depression, a deepening sense of meaningless and isolation, plummeting job satisfaction, life style health diseases and so many more indicators that something is profoundly wrong with the way that we engage in life.
Somehow in our headlong pursuit of progress driven by the mantra of radical individualism we have forgotten the very essence of what it is to be human or more importantly what it is to be a human a part of a deeply connected group of co-regulating, co-creating humans, humans who are not only in deep connection with themselves, each other but also in connection with their environment, in the syntropic dance of interdependence and co-creation.

## Choosing another path

It is clear that simply tinkering with the current socio-economic system implementing carbon taxes etc while well meaning is unlikely to create the meaningful change that is required. What is required instead is the creation of an entirely new system based on a new way of thinking and a new way of engaging socially and economically. Without this fundamental shift in consciousness no meaningful change can take place as we will tend to recreate the systems of the past.

There are many ways to change the fundamental belief systems.
The one is to highlight the insanity of the current system and to point to another possibility Marin Luther King is an example of this. Charles Eisenstein does a brilliant job of pointing a new possibilities in his books 'A more be beautiful world we know is possible' and 'Sacred Economics'.
Another possibility is to work deeply with the individual and collective nervous system, the traumas and patterns that have troubled ourselves and our ancestors. These unintegrated traumas lead feeling unsafe, inadequate, disconnected and unloved in the world. If you look carefully at the current economic system it becomes clear that it is the avoidance of feeling these feelings and the promise that something outside (job, money, cars, friends, children, lovers ...) will relieve this hollowness and fear that drives the entire system.

While the above mechanisms are absolutely essential as part of the journey of humanity there is another powerful way to change fundamental belief systems, this is to create a new system (usually backed by a new technology) that engages people in it and that through this engagement their old assumptions are automagically changed.

We believe that this is the real promise of Crypto. Crypto with its focus on non-hierarchical self-organising decentralised networks of people and technology that are continually collaborating, adapting and interacting for the greatest good of all participants is teaching us an entirely new way of organising human creativity.

We believe that crypto has arrived at this critical juncture in human evolution to provide us with all the tools, techniques and technologies to not only choose another path but to also create this new path as we walk it.

## A Brief History of Collaborative Creation

As with everything in the Dao of life when in reviewing our history we see not only the seeds that grew into the uniquely human beings that we are today with all our incredible gifts and contributions but also the seeds of the very crises that we find ourselves in today.
In the early recesses of our history we as a naked ape somehow found ourselves in the Savanna. Genetic analysis shows that we faced near extinction with less than 100 individuals, things were so severe that all of humanities genetic material stems from one mitochondrial eve. As naked two legged apes we were relatively slow, we had insignificant teeth and claws, with soft hides. The perfect prey animal and yet we not only survived this near extinction but instead we thrived as a species eventually living on every continent on earth, we became so adaptive that we a single species inhabits the extremes of subtropical jungles, deserts and frozen icecaps. We became the most fierce and dangerous hunters on the planet. What did our ancient ancestors do that allowed them to become so adaptive, so versatile and so powerful that we can threaten our very existence while showing all the promise of awakening to an entirely new state of consciousness, a deeper awareness of and in ourselves, each other and the earth herself?

### Collaboration

As apes we had a natural ability to engage in deep social relationships, to live in tightly knit collaborate troupes with nuanced social structures. Somehow we took this innate ability to collaborate deeply for collective good and added a capacity to envision longer time periods, to plan and organise activity over longer time periods. This capacity to collaborate, plan and strategise turned our capacity as two legged animals to breath more deeply while running and thus extending the time that we could run for into a massive hunting advantage, as a tag team we could literally run our four legged prey into exhaustion. Slowly through this collaboration along with the creativity below we transformed from one of the weakest prey animals into fierce hunters.

### Creativity, contemplation and learning

As we developed as hunters we slowly manoeuvred ourselves off of the endangered list and began to create enough space and safety that our deep collaboration and social bonds allowed us to begin to create together. We began by overcoming the limitations of our small teeth and weak nails by adapting rocks and sticks into tools for digging roots and cutting through animal skins, these eventually developed into tools for hunting and most recently space rockets, pokemon go, the internet and crypto. Creativity requires something very different an entirely anyone who has contemplated themselves creating will see that creativity involves a different type of thinking than the thinking required during hunting, scanning for predators or fighting for survival. Creativity thrives on having time and space where focus can be placed entirely on feeling and sensing the idea that is wanting to evolve, this is often called being in the Zone or Flow state. For this time and space to occur we need to feel safe enough, safe enough in our environment and safe enough within our tribe. We have all had the experience that it is incredibly difficult to create something new when our nervous system has been activated through some real or imagined existential threat.



As we evolved moved learning away from genetic and epigenetics to an full bodied learning.

Historically when we lived in small tribal groups we would track the behaviour and trustworthy of each person based on their previous performance. Since our number of interactions was in the 100's at most we could reliably track the reputation of each and every person that we interact with in our heads. We knew the best hunter, the best fisherman and the best canoe builder, we knew that if we gave the hind leg of an antelope to X they would in time repay this debt with fruit, bananas, music or friendship. Basically we could reliably assess our risk and opportunity in cocreating with, lending, borrowing or exchanging products with anyone in our immediate community. This natural system had the benefit of being able to make very rational decisions wrt to all our economic and social activity. The capacity to track reputation has an additional and critical side effect and that is that all members of the community are directly incentivised to behave well or at least well enough towards the other members of the community because their economic activity and even survival would be threatened if they developed a reputation as a bad actor. In a system like this there are obviously also many other side effects mostly relating to individual expression

* A massive reduction in individual expression through immense social and economic pressure to conform to potentially restrictive social norms of the tribal group.
* Limited opportunities to specialise around your own particular interests, desires, skills and personality.
* Limited opportunity to collaborate and co-create with other individuals or groups who share a common interest.

## The Role of Trust in an economic system

Since Trust is once the most precious commodity in our economy. Trusting our partners it is what allows us to engage with each other socially and economically in the safety that we will not be harmed, abused, scammed or taken advantage of. In the past the best systems that we knew how to create where systems where Trust was placed in the hands of trusted authorities (The Church in the dark ages, Kings and Queens, nation states, governments, education, doctors, big corporations) and yet time and again these centralised authorities have abused this trust using the authority that they derived from the position of trust to increasingly serve their own narrow needs and in so doing dominating and disenfranchising us the very people that they were originally intended to serve.



And yet we have had no choice but to continue to use these structures as despite all the disadvantages they still provide the basic trust mechanisms by which human collaboration and co-creation is organised.
