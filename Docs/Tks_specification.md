## Ecosystems

We believe that each major leap forward in the evolution of earths planetary consciousness and hence the evolution of each and every species on our planet and in fact the entire universe has resulted directly from the discovery of a previously unknown method of creative collaboration between species and within species. In fact you could view the evolution of our universe as a series of moves to ever increasing levels of syntropic order. Where syntropy is defined as the tendency towards energy concentration and order, essentially syntropy plots the evolution of consciousness to ever increasing levels of complexity which is achieved by higher and higher levels of collaborative creation (interdependence) between seemingly separate parts.
We need only look at the evolution of single cell organisms to highly collaborative multicellular organisms of increasing complexity to understand syntropic order.

Non biological systems show all the signs of syntropic order (you merely have to look at the emergence of solar systems, planets etc to see this in action). Biological intelligence has however shown that it can dramatically accelerate the evolution towards higher and higher levels of syntropic order through its capacity to collaborate and co-create. In fact this biological intelligence has not only created massively self-organising self-regulating ecosystems but in fact weaved these together ecosystems together into a single self-organising collaborating ecosystem (intelligence) that goes by the name of Earth, PachaMama, Gaia and so many more.

## The current status quo of Human Civilisation

By now it is clear that humanity is at some sort of cust, a fork in the road. The current path of extractive hierarchically based economic systems are barrelling down a bleak path directly into the looming ecological collapse and economic disaster. You don't need to look far to see all the signs of this impending implosion.
While the current economic systems consisting of the government-military-industrial-petroleum-pharma-agricultural-education-BigTech barrels us towards this disaster these same systems despite their promises of improving human prosperity have instead continued to create systems that are increasingly human unfriendly. Again you do not need to look far to see all the evidence of this played out in every aspect of human life from souring depression, a deepening sense of meaningless and isolation, plummeting job satisfaction, life style health diseases and so many more indicators that something is profoundly wrong with the way that we engage in life.
Somehow in our headlong pursuit of progress driven by the mantra of individualism we have forgotten the very essence of what it is to be human or more importantly what it is to be a human a part of a deeply connected group of co-regulating, co-creating humans, humans who are not only in deep connection with themselves, each other but also in connection with their environment, in the syntropic dance of interdependence and co-creation.

## Choosing another path

It is clear that simply tinkering with the current socio-economic system by implementing carbon taxes etc while well meaning is unlikely to create any meaningful change. What is instead required is an entirely new system based on a new way of thinking and a new way of engaging economically. Without a fundamental shift in this consciousness no meaningful change can take place as we will tend to recreate the systems of the past.

Now there are many ways to change the fundamental belief systems. 
The one is to highlight another possibility and Charles Eisenstein does a brilliant job of pointing a new possibilities in his books 'a more be beautiful world that we know is possible' and 'Sacred Economics'.
Another method is to work deeply with the nervous system trauma's and patterns that have troubled ourselves and our ancestors. The trauma's that lead to us feeling unsafe, inadequate, disconnected and unloved in the world as it is from these trauma's and the avoidance of the pain of feeling them that the current economic systems are built.
Another powerful way to change fundamental belief systems is to create a new technology that engages people in it and that through this engagement their old assumptions are automagically changed.
