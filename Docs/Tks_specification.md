## Ecosystems

We believe that each major leap forward in the evolution of earths planetary consciousness and hence the evolution of each and every species on our planet and in fact the entire universe has resulted directly from the discovery of a previously unknown method of creative collaboration between species and within species. In fact you could view the evolution of our universe as a series of moves to ever increasing levels of syntropic order. Where syntropy is defined as the tendency towards energy concentration and order, essentially syntropy plots the evolution of consciousness to ever increasing levels of complexity which is achieved by higher and higher levels of collaborative creation (interdependence) between seemingly separate parts.
We need only look at the evolution of single cell organisms to highly collaborative multicellular organisms of increasing complexity to understand syntropic order.

Non biological systems show all the signs of syntropic order (you merely have to look at the emergence of solar systems, planets etc to see this in action). Biological intelligence has however shown that it can dramatically accelerate the evolution towards higher and higher levels of syntropic order through its capacity to collaborate and co-create. In fact this biological intelligence has not only created massively self-organising self-regulating ecosystems but in fact weaved these together ecosystems together into a single self-organising collaborating ecosystem (intelligence) that goes by the name of Earth, PachaMama, Gaia and so many more.

## The current status quo of Human Civilisation

By now it is clear that humanity is at some sort of cust, a fork in the road. The current path of extractive hierarchically based economic systems are barrelling down a bleak path directly into the looming ecological collapse and economic disaster. You don't need to look far to see all the signs of this impending implosion.
While the current economic systems consisting of the government-military-industrial-petroleum-pharma-agricultural-education-BigTech barrels us towards this disaster these same systems despite their promises of improving human prosperity have instead continued to create systems that are increasingly human unfriendly. Again you do not need to look far to see all the evidence of this played out in every aspect of human life from souring depression, a deepening sense of meaningless and isolation, plummeting job satisfaction, life style health diseases and so many more indicators that something is profoundly wrong with the way that we engage in life.
Somehow in our headlong pursuit of progress driven by the mantra of radical individualism we have forgotten the very essence of what it is to be human or more importantly what it is to be a human a part of a deeply connected group of co-regulating, co-creating humans, humans who are not only in deep connection with themselves, each other but also in connection with their environment, in the syntropic dance of interdependence and co-creation.

## Choosing another path

It is clear that simply tinkering with the current socio-economic system implementing carbon taxes etc while well meaning is unlikely to create the meaningful change that is required. What is required instead is the creation of an entirely new system based on a new way of thinking and a new way of engaging socially and economically. Without this fundamental shift in consciousness no meaningful change can take place as we will tend to recreate the systems of the past.

There are many ways to change the fundamental belief systems.
The one is to highlight the insanity of the current system and to point to another possibility Marin Luther King is an example of this. Charles Eisenstein does a brilliant job of pointing a new possibilities in his books 'A more be beautiful world we know is possible' and 'Sacred Economics'.
Another possibility is to work deeply with the individual and collective nervous system, the traumas and patterns that have troubled ourselves and our ancestors. These unintegrated traumas lead feeling unsafe, inadequate, disconnected and unloved in the world. If you look carefully at the current economic system it becomes clear that it is the avoidance of feeling these feelings and the promise that something outside (job, money, cars, friends, children, lovers ...) will relieve this hollowness and fear that drives the entire system.

While the above mechanisms are absolutely essential as part of the journey of humanity there is another powerful way to change fundamental belief systems, this is to create a new system (usually backed by a new technology) that engages people in it and that through this engagement their old assumptions are automagically changed.

We believe that this is the real promise of Crypto. Crypto with its focus on non-hierarchical self-organising decentralised networks of people and technology that are continually collaborating, adapting and interacting for the greatest good of all participants is teaching us an entirely new way of organising human creativity.

We believe that crypto has arrived at this critical juncture in human evolution to provide us with all the tools, techniques and technologies to not only choose another path but to also create this new path as we walk it.

## The Role of Trust in an economic system

Trust is the most precious commodity in our economy it is what allows us to engage with each other socially and economically in the safety that we will not be harmed, abused or taken advantage of. In the past the best systems that we knew how to create where systems where Trust was placed in the hands of trusted authorities (The Church in the dark ages, Kings and Queens, nation states, governments, education, doctors, big corporations) and yet time and again these centralised authorities have abused this trust using the authority that they derived from the position of trust to increasingly serve their own narrow needs and in so doing dominating and disenfranchising us the very people that they were originally intended to serve.

And yet we have had no choice but to continue to use these structures as despite all the disadvantages they still provide the basic trust mechanisms by which human collaboration and co-creation is organised.
